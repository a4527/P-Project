# User Flow

This document describes how the web application starts, what the user sees, and what happens in the backend when each feature is used.

## 1. Startup Flow

### 1.1 Backend starts

1. The user runs `./gradlew bootRun` in `springboot/`.
2. Gradle starts `ServerApplication.main()`.
3. Spring Boot creates the application context.
4. Beans are loaded:
   - controllers
   - services
   - repositories
   - security configuration
   - WebClient configuration
5. JPA connects to the H2 in-memory database and updates the schema.
6. `CampusDataInitializer` seeds the campus and building metadata.
7. `ParkingLotAssetSyncService` scans `fastapi/video_test/videos/*_video*.mp4` and creates parking-lot rows when matching assets exist.
8. `ParkingStatusService` starts polling FastAPI `/status` every 5 seconds.
9. Spring Boot starts the embedded web server on port `8080`.

### 1.2 Browser opens the site

1. The user opens `http://localhost:8080/`.
2. Spring Boot returns `index.html` from `springboot/src/main/resources/static/`.
3. The browser loads `app.css` and `app.js`.
4. `app.js` runs after `DOMContentLoaded`.
5. `app.js` fetches:
   - `GET /api/ui/config`
   - `GET /api/campus/map`
6. The screen is rendered with:
   - campus header
   - building list
   - campus map
   - selected building detail
   - login panel
   - notifications panel
   - current parking location panel

## 2. Main Screen Layout

The page is divided into these sections:

1. Top header
   - campus name
   - Naver Map status
   - unread notification badge
2. Left sidebar
   - login form
   - current parking location card
   - in-app notification list
   - building list
3. Main content
   - campus map
   - selected building detail
   - parking-lot cards

## 3. Login Flow

### 3.1 Register

1. The user enters username and password in the login panel.
2. The user clicks `회원가입`.
3. The browser sends `POST /auth/register`.
4. `AuthService.register()` checks whether the username already exists.
5. If the user does not exist:
   - password is hashed with BCrypt
   - the user is saved in the `users` table
6. The response is a simple status string such as:
   - `REGISTER_SUCCESS`
   - `USER_EXISTS`

### 3.2 Login

1. The user enters username and password.
2. The user clicks `로그인`.
3. The browser sends `POST /auth/login`.
4. `AuthService.login()`:
   - finds the user by username
   - checks the password with BCrypt
   - creates a JWT if the password is valid
5. The response is JSON:

```json
{
  "token": "...",
  "username": "alice"
}
```

6. The browser stores the token in `localStorage` under `smartparking_token`.
7. The page then calls:
   - `GET /auth/me`
   - `GET /api/me/parking-location/current`
   - `GET /api/me/notifications`
   - `GET /api/me/notifications/unread-count`
   - `GET /api/me/alert-rules`
8. The login panel and user badges update.

### 3.3 Token validation

1. Each user-only request includes:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

2. `JwtAuthenticationFilter` reads the header.
3. `JwtUtil` validates the signature and expiration.
4. If valid, Spring Security stores the username in the security context.
5. `/api/me/**` endpoints are then allowed.

## 4. Campus and Building Flow

### 4.1 Campus map

1. `app.js` calls `GET /api/campus/map`.
2. `CampusMapService` refreshes filesystem-driven parking-lot data.
3. It loads:
   - campus data
   - building list
   - parking-lot summaries
   - cached parking status from FastAPI
4. The browser renders the building cards and the campus map markers.

### 4.2 Select a building

1. The user clicks a building card or a map marker.
2. `app.js` calls `GET /api/campus/buildings/{buildingId}`.
3. The backend returns:
   - campus data
   - selected building data
   - parking-lot list for that building
4. The browser renders each parking lot as a separate card.

## 5. Parking-Lot Map Flow

Each parking lot has its own card and its own map workflow.

### 5.1 If no source image exists

1. The parking-lot card shows:
   - total slots
   - available slots
   - disabled-slot availability
   - status
2. The map panel shows that no photo has been uploaded yet.
3. The user can:
   - upload a photo
   - start the map builder

### 5.2 Upload source image

1. The user selects an image file.
2. The browser sends `POST /api/parking-lots/{parkingLotId}/map/upload`.
3. `ParkingLotMapService` stores the image at:
   - `fastapi/video_test/images/{partitionKey}_image.png`
4. Existing generated map files are cleared so the lot returns to an unbuilt state.

### 5.3 Launch map builder

1. The user clicks `지도 제작하기`.
2. The browser sends `POST /api/parking-lots/{parkingLotId}/map/build`.
3. Spring Boot starts `fastapi/map_builder/map_builder_gui0.py`.
4. The map builder opens with the uploaded photo.
5. The user places and edits slot boxes.
6. Keyboard shortcuts in the builder:
   - `s`: save and exit
   - `d`: delete the selected slot
   - `q`: quit
7. When saved, the builder writes:
   - `fastapi/video_test/map/{partitionKey}_map.png`
   - `fastapi/video_test/map/{partitionKey}_slots.json`

### 5.4 Render generated map

1. `app.js` refreshes the building detail.
2. If `slotLayoutJson` exists, the browser draws the slot boxes over the blurred background image.
3. Slot colors mean:
   - green: available
   - red: occupied
   - blue: available disabled slot
4. The user can click a slot to select it.

## 6. Save Parking Location Flow

### 6.1 Save current slot

1. The user clicks a slot on a parking-lot map.
2. The selected slot id is stored in the browser state for that lot.
3. The user clicks `내 위치 저장`.
4. The browser sends:

```http
POST /api/me/parking-location
```

with a body like:

```json
{
  "parkingLotId": 1,
  "slotId": 3,
  "vehicleLabel": "My Car",
  "memo": "학생회관 근처"
}
```

5. `ParkingLocationService`:
   - finds the current user
   - finds the parking lot
   - deactivates any previously active saved location
   - saves the new active location
6. The sidebar updates to show the current parking location.

### 6.2 Release parking location

1. The user clicks `주차 종료`.
2. The browser sends:

```http
DELETE /api/me/parking-location/current
```

3. `ParkingLocationService` marks the active record as inactive.
4. The release time is stored.
5. The sidebar returns to the empty state.

## 7. In-App Notification Flow

### 7.1 Create an alert rule

1. The user selects a parking lot.
2. The user enters a threshold number, such as `5`.
3. The user clicks `알림 등록`.
4. The browser sends:

```http
POST /api/me/alert-rules
```

with a body like:

```json
{
  "parkingLotId": 1,
  "minimumAvailableSlots": 5,
  "enabled": true
}
```

5. `ParkingAlertRuleService` stores the rule.

### 7.2 Monitor and notify

1. `ParkingAlertMonitorService` runs on a schedule.
2. It reads the cached FastAPI status from `ParkingStatusService`.
3. For each enabled rule, it checks whether available slots crossed the threshold.
4. If the rule transitions from unmet to met:
   - an in-app notification row is created
5. The notification appears in the sidebar notification panel.

### 7.3 Read notifications

1. The browser loads notifications with:
   - `GET /api/me/notifications`
   - `GET /api/me/notifications/unread-count`
2. The user clicks a notification.
3. The browser sends:

```http
PATCH /api/me/notifications/{notificationId}/read
```

4. The notification is marked as read.
5. The unread count badge updates.
